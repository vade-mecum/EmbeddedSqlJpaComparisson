# A sample JPA project 
## With connections to H2, HSQLDB, and SQLITE

JPA testing project - comparing Embedded SQLite, H2, and HSQLDB.

Includes a simple sample of embedded ID's and enums.  
The sample does not try to be an extensive use case of JPA, 
but provides a simple skeleton for trying it out on
the different databases for compatibility.

There is also a simple performance test for comparison included.  It is not very exhaustive, purely illustrative.
